# gframe
gframe is a python framework that lets people easily create all sorts of games easily.
# How To Use
WHEN THE FIRST VERION IS DONE, simply create a init.py in the folder with the other files if you dont already have one. Then put

    import gframe
    gframe.init()

That's the start for every game. From that point on, look in the wiki.
